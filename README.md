Pointers to follow#
Avoid using inline styling
Keep the documentation & component styles separated from each other
Look into various CSS frameworks for inspiration. For example
BootStrap
Materialize
Semantic UI
Bulma
PureCSS
Skeleton CSS
Milligram
Foundation
If you are following any naming convention make sure you use it consistently
To add code examples in your documentation, you can use
carbon.now.sh
highlight.js
